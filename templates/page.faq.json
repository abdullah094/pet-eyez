When the dog’s body breaks down red blood cells, a naturally occurring molecule remains as a waste product. These molecules, known as porphyrins, contain iron, which is responsible for the red coloration, which gets darker when exposed to sunlight. Porphyrins are usually excreted via the digestive system but in dogs, they are also removed from the body in urine, saliva and tears. Darker coated dogs can also suffer from tear stains, but the marks are harder to see on the dark hair. It is a good idea to check your dog’s eyes regularly for any problems.  <\/p>"}},"2c54f3ba-0663-4e0f-8b8b-1f79a4c27c7a":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"<em><strong>Does tap water cause tear stainsin dogs?<\/strong><\/em>","answer":"<p>High mineral content in your dog's drinking water can also contribute to tear stains—staining around the mouth can tip you off.

Low-quality ingredients in your dog's food like fillers can cause allergic reactions that result in excess tearing, too<\/p>"}},"3859e0f0-83af-4e96-885c-9e8b0d94eee2":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"<em><strong>What are other causes of tear stains ?<\/strong><\/em>","answer":"<p><strong>Glaucoma<\/strong> – a serious condition that causes a build-up of pressure in the eye and can damage the optic nerve.<\/p><p><strong>Eye infection<\/strong> – infections by bacteria, viruses or parasites can cause a discharge from the eye.<\/p><p><strong>Conjunctivitis<\/strong> – inflammation in the eye’s lining can cause mucus, pus or discharge.<\/p><p><strong>Ear infection<\/strong> – may cause the eye on the same side of the head to tear more than is usual.<\/p><p><strong>Ingrown eyelashes<\/strong> – these can rub against the surface of the eye, causing irritation and damage.<\/p><p><strong>Entropion<\/strong> – a condition where the eyelid rolls in, causing the eyelashes to rub against the eye and causing irritation.<\/p><p>Blocked tear duct<\/p><p>Allergies<\/p><p>Cornea injury<\/p><p>Medications<\/p><p>pH imbalance<\/p><p>Red meat in the diet which<br\/>contains iron and other minerals<\/p><p>Poor diet, excess carbohydrates,<br\/>vitamin or mineral deficiency\/excess<\/p><p>Stress<\/p><p>Teething issues, especially<br\/>puppies<\/p><p>Plastic food and water bowls<\/p><p>Water quality<\/p><p>Be sure to consult with a professional if your pets’ tear stains persist for longer than 30 days after taking Pet Eyez™.  <\/p>"}},"a4c4a54f-bb3f-4f77-927a-b65d85ebb06e":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"<em><strong>Are blueberries good for dogs?<\/strong><\/em>","answer":"<p>Blueberries are a superfood rich in antioxidants, which prevent cell damage in humans and canines alike.
